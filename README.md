## 🎓 **Revolutionizing Student Education with AI-Generated Video Content**  
This project aims to enhance the learning experience by using **AI-generated videos** to deliver high-quality, personalized, and interactive educational content to students. The solution leverages advanced **AI models** and cloud technologies to automate the creation of educational materials across various subjects.  

---

## 📚 **Problem Statement**  
Traditional educational systems often rely on **static and one-size-fits-all** teaching methods that do not cater to individual student learning needs. Manual creation of high-quality educational content is also **time-consuming and resource-intensive**, making it difficult to scale to a larger audience.  

---

## 💡 **Solution Overview**  
Our solution integrates **AI models with Firebase Genkit** to automatically generate educational video content across multiple domains such as:  
✅ Visual Arts  
✅ Performing Arts  
✅ Coding  
✅ Financial Literacy  
✅ Science  

The AI adapts the content to each student’s level, ensuring a **personalized and engaging learning journey** that can be delivered through platforms like TAPBuddy.
